## Problems with traditional warehouse
  * Data must fit into relational schema
  
## Value in Data-analytics
   * Descriptive : What happen ?
   * Diagnostic : Why did it happen ?
   * Predictive : What will happen ?
   * Prescriptive : How can we make it happen ?

 ## Big-Data
   Big data is data whoes scale, diversity and complexity require new archietecture, technology to extract it analyse it.
   
 ## Variety of Big Data
  * Structure - well defined schema
  * Semi-strucured - partially defined model
  * unstructured - undefined data model
  
  
 ## Exploiting localty of reference
    Bringing the data where the compute is.
    using COTS - commercially off the shelf
    
 ## Distribute Data and Computation
    Data Source --> Hadoop Cluster
